Github Page

Statement of Work:
Building the Neural Network -
	Define the following functions:
Loss 
Training
Test Accuracy
Test Batch
Test Classes
Convert to ONNX
Device for training: (CPU) 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11700F @ 2.50GHz, 2496 Mhz, 8 Core(s), 16 Logical Processor(s)
Dataset-
	Using Pytorch preloaded dataset for training (CIFAR10)
	Loading desired dataset.
	Iterate and Visualize. 
	Iterate through the data.
	Accuracy on test data.

Retrospective:
What went well?
The learning process in general went well, I felt confident I could achieve something. I also ended up with a working app and the model successfully deployed even though it's not perfect. 

What went wrong?
Nearly everything, every step there were hurdles to overcome. I almost cut the project down many times because of the frustrations.

How might you have done things differently?
I would have done a few things differently such as more testing and more time spent on adjusting the aesthetics of the app. 

What about the project are you most disappointed with?
Iâ€™m most disappointed with the model itself and the low accuracy rates. Although about 60% is considered acceptable I would like to see it higher and plan to adjust the epochs and run the model through my GPU. 

What about the project are you most proud of?
The success of getting the model deployed to an app was very satisfying. 

How in the future might you do things differently?
In the future I'll be sure to take more time with the models and build a few from the ground up with python instead of relying on pytorch.
